Getting help with R
Sometimes getting help in R is confusing. Here's some things you can try:

bacollite::    # lists availble functions in a pop-out in rstudio
help(foo)      # help about function foo
?foo           # same thing 
apropos("foo") # list all functions containing string foo
example(foo)   # show an example of function foo

Seqeunce Data
Bioarch Mammalian Collagen Dataset
A version of this dataset is available within the package as an R object called bioarch_mammal_sequences. The data set currently holds sequences for

human
sheep
cow
goat
It is based on the sheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMIJWZtAZ8zJ4uwbAUpwTp_deBwKeVJ8FoBQopXL_dc/edit?usp=sharing], as at 09:48 on 11 January 2017

Loading other seqeunce data:
Other sequence sets can be loaded via googleshets:

require(googlesheets)
mc_meta <-gs_title("Mammalian Collagen Sequences v0.0.2")
sequences <- gs_read(mc_meta)
Alternatively, the google sheet can be exported as a .csv file to your computer, and then loaded like so:

 bms0.1.2 <- read.table(file="Mammalian Collagen Sequences v0.1.2 - Mammal.csv",sep=",")

See [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMIJWZtAZ8zJ4uwbAUpwTp_deBwKeVJ8FoBQopXL_dc/edit#gid=269004764] for the required format of these sheets
